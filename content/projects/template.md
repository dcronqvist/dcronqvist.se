### What is restberry-api?
This is an API which is primarily used for personal finance management. Written in Python using [Flask-RESTX](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with all data stored in a self-hosted [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

For now, check out the [repo](https://github.com/dcronqvist/restberry-api), since this is a constantly evolving project, and having a look at the README.md of the project will give a better insight to its current state! :D
