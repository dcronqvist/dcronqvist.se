### Simulation of logic gates and integrated circuits

**logix** is a passion project of mine, which I come back to every now and then when I get an urge to make a computer from scratch *again*.

It all started back in Sweden's equivalent of high school (or upper secondary school, eh whatever, year 10, 11, 12 of school), where I had a course where we touched on the subject of logic gates and creating integrated circuits out of these gates. I say *touched*, but the final project in that course was about creating a small computer with some kind of memory, together with a really basic [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture), in [Logicly](https://logic.ly/).

Logix is the continuation of my interest of building computers from scratch like that, combined with my interest for making Open Source projects which anyone can use and contribute to. Using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), I've made a simulator in which I can place out logic gates, connect them up, and simulate their behaviour and outputs. In addition to this, I've made it possible to extract the logic from a selection of logic gates, to create integrated circuits which can be copied and placed out.
