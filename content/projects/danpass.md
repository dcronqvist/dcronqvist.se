### A simple password manager

The life on the internet can get out of hand quite quickly since you need accounts on every single website it feels like. So I thought, why not make a password manager to learn a bit about encryption! 

All passwords in danpass are saved using [Fernet encryption](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/), which is very basic - but it does the job! Using **danpass** is super easy, since it only works from the command line. 

Want to know what commands there are and how they work? Check the [README](https://github.com/dcronqvist/danpass).
