Alright, it's been a while since my last update on the puzzle game I'm working on, so here goes. I figure that screenshots and gifs are the best way to showcase the current state of the game.

**Beware that literally EVERYTHING is subject to change.**

Oh, and in case it wasn't clear, the game is called _Quackoban_ (for now at least lol).

Hopefully that gives you an idea of where the game is at right now - even though I haven't shown everything yet. I still have plenty of levels to design and create, but most of the core puzzle mechanics are in place.

I aim to make sure that it is possible to make user-generated levels as well, for example through Steam Workshop - that way the community can come up with even more creative puzzles than I likely ever could.

Anyway, I have a lot of level designing ahead of me, but I'm excited about the direction the game is taking. Releasing this year is no longer the plan, early next year seems more realistic - hoping to take part in some game festivals as well to gain a bit of exposure.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop _Quackoban_! Let me know if you're interested in playtesting through the `e-mail contact` button in the footer.

Quack quack!
