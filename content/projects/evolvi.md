### My final project in high school

So for my final project in high school I wanted to do something that I had been interested in for quite some time. Around this time I was watching a lot of [carykh's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9z7EZAbkphEMg0SP7rw44A), like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8) where he's built an evolution simulator.

This got me really interested in the subject, and I watched maybe 1000 (obviously an exaggeration) other videos on genetic algorithms and even [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies). Because of this, I decided that I should try to make something similar on my own, which then became my high school final project, now called **evolvi**.

There are a couple of gifs of the simulator in action on the [GitHub README](https://github.com/dcronqvist/evolvi), so have a look!
