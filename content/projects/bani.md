### Line of least resistance

So to keep track of my personal finance, I keep wanting to make it less and less difficult to actually register transactions, both in and out. In this pursuit of making it less and less difficult, I decided to make a discord bot which is able to register transactions for me!

I can just type in a command in a channel and just like that, the transaction is done! :)
